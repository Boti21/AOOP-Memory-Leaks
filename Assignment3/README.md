# Things to Note
We did not quite manage to implement all the functionalities that we intended.
For example, the preset queries exist and correctly handle the data as wanted, but were not implemented fully into the view in a dynamic and usable way. Instead, we focused on making the graphs personalized (such as selecting a XSource and YSource, which doesn't work dynamically yet but the logic exists), as well as wanting to add things customization such as axis color, font type, ranges etc. However, some of these things were really difficult to implement logically without clutter, following MVVM, SOLID, and also having 4 different graph types.

Lastly, we attempted to make another Settings view for the preset queries but did not finish implementing it.
