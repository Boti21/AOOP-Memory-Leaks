# Reasons for not working
The group had originally started working separately on completely separate parts of the project,
this, however lead to lacking interoperability between parts. This is a group organization issue
and we are aware of it. We will try to fix it for the next assignment.

After spending 24 collective man-hours trying to make everything work we did not succeed.
The UI does not update when a certain List is updated and we have tried everything within and 
beyond our abilities to fix it. This alone derailed the project enough where a complete
rewrite was the best course of action, but at that point in time this was no possible due to time-constraints.
