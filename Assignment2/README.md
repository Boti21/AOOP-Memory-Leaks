# AOOP-Memory-Leaks
SDU Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Assignment 2

### Group members
- Balazs Szakal
- Botond Bencsik
- Max Bohk

##### Contributions
- Balazs Szakal: Backend code (Models)

- Botond Bencsik: Frontend (Views)

- Max Bohk: Unit testing and ViewModels

# Things to Consider
The group had originally started working separately on completely separate parts of the project,
this, however lead to lacking interoperability between parts. This is a group organization issue
and we are aware of it. We will try to fix it for the next assignment.

# Things to Note
We did not quite manage to implement all the functionalities that we intended.
For example, the preset queries exist and correctly handle the data as wanted, but were not implemented fully into the view in a dynamic and usable way. Instead, we focused on making the graphs personalized (such as selecting a XSource and YSource, which doesn't work dynamically yet but the logic exists), as well as wanting to add things customization such as axis color, font type, ranges etc. However, some of these things were really difficult to implement logically without clutter, following MVVM, SOLID, and also having 4 different graph types.
